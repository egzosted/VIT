This project was created to revise my vocabulary before tests. I did it to fast ensure that I can pass an exam without any
problems. <br/><br/>
<b>Usage:</b> <br/>
Just launch file main.py and then provide path to your file with vocabulary. It has to be in a certain order. One word in a
single line. You start from a correct translation and in next line you put word in a language you want to see word to translate.
